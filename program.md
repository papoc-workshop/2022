### Invited Talk 2: A Programmable Cloud: CALM Foundations and Open Challenges
**Joseph M. Hellerstein, Professor, UC Berkeley**  
_17:30, 60m, remote_  

#### Abstract

The public cloud emerged a decade ago, yet distributed systems are still
programmed using models from sequential computing. All the traditional
challenges of distributed programming and data are still present in the cloud,
only they are now faced by the general population of software developers. Added
to these challenges are new desires for "serverless" computing, including
consumption-based pricing and autoscaling.
 
This talk will highlight principles for cloud programming that I have explored
with colleagues over the past decade, including the CALM Theorem and languages
like Dedalus and Bloom that encourage monotonic coordination-free consistency
via logic and lattices. The Anna "any-scale" KVS will be presented as a petri
dish for the potential of these ideas and many remaining challenges. 

I will conclude by overviewing new work in the Hydro project, which is aimed at
bringing research ideas to programmers in an practical, evolutionary fashion.
Key to our approach is a separation of distributed programs into a PACT of four
facets: Program semantics, Availablity, Consistency and Trust. We propose to
migrate developers gradually to PACT programming by lifting familiar code into
our more declarative level of abstraction. This agenda raises challenges across
multiple areas including language design, query optimization, transactions,
distributed consistency, compilers and program synthesis.

#### Bio 

Joe Hellerstein is the Jim Gray Professor of Computer Science at the University
of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on data-centric systems and the
way they drive computing. Hellerstein is an ACM Fellow, a Sloan Research Fellow
and the recipient of three ACM-SIGMOD Test of Time awards. In 2010, MIT's
Technology Review magazine included his work on cloud programming in their TR10
list of the 10 technologies "most likely to change our world". In addition to
his academic work, Hellerstein has been involved in a number of startup
companies including Trifacta, which brought academic research on data wrangling
to market.
