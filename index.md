title: PaPoC Workshop 2022
---

The 9th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data
(PaPoC) will take place on April 5th, 2022, in conjunction with
[EuroSys 2022](https://2022.eurosys.org).

### Background

PaPoC 2022 is a successor to previous workshops in this series 
([PaPoC 2014](http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/), 
[PaPoC 2015](http://papoc.di.uminho.pt/), 
[PaPoC 2016](http://www2.ucsc.edu/papoc-2016/), 
[PaPoC 2017](http://software.imdea.org/Conferences/PAPOC17/program.shtml), 
[PaPoC 2018](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2018/), 
[PaPoC 2019](https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/conferences/papoc19/), 
[PaPoC 2020](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2020/) and
[PaPoC 2021](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2021/)) which brought together
researchers and practitioners in the areas of distributed systems, programming
languages, databases, and concurrent programming.

The PaPoC workshop investigates the trade-offs among different consistency
models for distributed systems, and their operational characteristics. While
stronger consistency models can be easier for programmers to reason about,
weaker consistency models can often provide better availability and performance.
Beyond the well-known tension between Consistency, Availability, and
Partition-tolerance, as captured by the CAP theorem, many nuanced consistency
models and algorithms have been developed for different purposes. Distributed
consistency models are needed in large-scale datacenter-based systems, but also
in edge networks with wide geographic distribution, and even in end-user
applications running on mobile devices with intermittent network connectivity.
It is clear that there is no universally best solution for sharing data in these
different settings.

In order to address these challenges, the PaPoC workshop brings together
theoreticians and practitioners from different horizons: system development,
distributed algorithms, concurrency, fault tolerance, databases, programming
languages and verification, including both academia and industry. Topics of
interest include (but are not limited to) models and mechanisms for consistency
in distributed systems, including replicated data types/CRDTs, causal
consistency, transaction isolation levels, hybrid consistency models such as
RedBlue consistency, analysis of program correctness with regard to different
consistency models, formal verification of consistency properties, and studies
of performance, scalability, and programmability.
